# Exosky
Project Overview

Exosky is an educational web application developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge that allows users to explore the night sky as it would appear from distant exoplanets. Leveraging data from NASAâ€™s Exoplanet Archive and the Gaia DR3 star catalog, the app simulates the view of the stars from the perspective of any confirmed exoplanet. Students and astronomy enthusiasts can interactively visualize a star map, create their own constellations, and export high-quality images of their custom night sky.

The app is designed to provide an immersive and engaging experience, making space science accessible to all levels of learners. Users can choose an exoplanet, view its star field, and adjust settings to focus on different levels of detail, offering both casual and advanced astronomy features.
